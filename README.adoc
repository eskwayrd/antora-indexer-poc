= antora-indexer-poc

This repo demonstrates how to add link:https://lunrjs.com/[lunr.js]
indexing to Antora builds, and a search UI to the Antora default UI.

[NOTE]
======
This is a proof of concept. It should work, but there are no
guarantees.

- The code has not been tested on Windows.
- The search UI has only been tested in Google Chrome.
- Improvements to make the search UI responsive have not yet been made.
======


== Usage

=== Easy

Run `make`, which:

- Installs dependencies.
- Runs Antora to generate HTML and produce an index
- Runs serve so that you can browse the HTML and use the search UI


=== Individual steps

Follow these steps if you don't have `make` installed, or you want to
see how everything works:

1. Install all of the dependencies:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm i
----

2. Run Antora to generate HTML and an index:
+
[source,bash]
----
node_modules/.bin/antora --generator=./generator/generator.js antora-playbook.yml
----

By default, the HTML and index are place in the `public` folder.

3. Run serve to start a web service so that you can browse the HTML and
use the search UI:
+
[source,bash]
----
node_modules/.bin/serve public/
----
+
Serve emits URLs that you can use, e.g. `http://localhost:5000`. Copy
the URL into your browser.


== Search UI

The search UI is implemented as a drop-down menu, containing all
matching entries. Results update immediately as you type. Use the
kbd:[Arrow Up] and kbd:[Arrow Down] keys to select a result, and press
kbd:[Enter] to navigate to that result (or just click). Press
kbd:[Escape] to close the results.


== Notes

- The included `antora-playbook.yml` is configured to use the Antora
  documentation. This demonstrates an excellent Antora feature: you can
  generate HTML for any documentation that exists in an Antora component
  in any accessible Git-based repository.
+
Antora's documentation is comprised of two components, one for Antora
itself and another for its UI, and the Antora component has multiple
versions. This is useful to demonstrate the 'faceting' of the search
results, which are combined into groups based on the component +
version.

- You can use the search with your own documentation by revising the
  `content:` section of the `antora-playbook.yml` file.

- The `supplemental_ui` folder contains the search UI, as override files
  for Antora's default UI.

- lunr indexes can often become quite large. The
  link:https://github.com/nodeca/pako[pako] library is used to compress
  the index when it is created, and is also used to decompress the index
  in the browser. Typically, the compressed index is about 20% the size
  of the uncompressed index.
+
As such, using lunr for search is best for sites with only a modest
amount of content. Large sites likely require a search service, such as
Algolia, to avoid distributing large indexes to all new users of your
documentation site.
